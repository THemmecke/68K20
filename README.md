# 68K20
68020 Board EAGLE/VHDL

This repository contains EAGLE and VHDL sources for a 68020 based SBC. The ECB based SBC provides a 68020 cpu, 68881/2 FPU, full 32 bit address and databus, 4MB SRAM and 512KB FLASH on board, 12(C)887 RTC.
It can be used with the GDP-FPGA (https://github.com/THemmecke/GDPFPGAII) to build a complete microcomputer system.
